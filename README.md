# Expo Camera Preview Freeze

This repository demonstrates an intermittent bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API within a custom camera component. The preview freezes unexpectedly, requiring app restart. This issue is challenging to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

The camera preview freezes randomly.  No specific actions consistently trigger the freeze. The issue appears tied to memory management or interactions with other Expo modules, as it doesn't occur in simpler applications.

## Reproduction Steps

Reproducing this bug is inconsistent.  However, using the app for an extended period, and potentially performing other actions like navigating to other screens or interacting with other components, increases the likelihood of observing the freeze.

## Potential Causes

* Memory leaks in the camera component or related modules.
* Conflicts with other Expo APIs or libraries.
* Issues related to background processes or multitasking.
* Timing or race conditions.

## Solution (Potential)

The exact solution may depend on the specific root cause, which can be challenging to pinpoint.  The provided `cameraBugSolution.js` demonstrates potential fixes that might address this issue, like better memory management and optimization of the camera component.
